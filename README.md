# Baboon Learning

## Overview

Despite a recent dramatic rise in the deployment of animal-borne movement sensors, very few studies have attempted to use movement data to classify fine-scale behavioral activity of animals. The purpose of this project is to explore classifying behavioral activity of baboons with deep neural networks. 

Baboons were fitted with e-obs biologging collars that collected data from GPS units, tri-axial accelerometeres and magnetometers. The GPS sampled at 1 Hz and the accelerometer and amgnetometer sampled at 12 Hz. Data from these collars amounted to 180,000 labeled samples and approximately 200 million unlabeled samples. 

Given the size of the data, the performance of several deep neural networks were compared and resulted in the best deep learning classifier for animal locomotor behavior. To leverage the unlabeled samples, an unsupervised learning approach is explored to determine if it helps boost the performance of the supervised learning models.
